                        <h2>How do Managed <span class="font-green-mormal">APPLICATIONS</span> work within Managed Office?</h2>
                        <p class="fs14b">Managed Office provides your business with a wide range of business applications that you get as a service, which essentially means you'll never have to purchase or upgrade your software again. Managed Office frees you up to focus on your core business, rather than the underlying technology that makes it work day to day.  </p>
